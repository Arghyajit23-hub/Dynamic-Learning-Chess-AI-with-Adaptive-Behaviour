# Dynamic-Learning-Chess-AI-with-Adaptive-Behaviour (Oct 2025 – Nov 2025)
- Designed a feature-based Chess AI using Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning, integrating a learned evaluation function for strategic move selection.
- Engineered interpretable board evaluation features and optimized weights using Conjugate Gradient. 
- Implemented adaptive play-style control via a meta-parameter optimized using Golden Section Search, 
enabling dynamic aggression/defence based on performance. 
- Achieved 16% higher win rate and 37% fewer moves compared to a static baseline through continuous self
play learning.
